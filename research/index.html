	<h1>Research</h1>
	<p>I am currently on the TolTEC camera team, working on simulations for planning future surveys when the instrument is commissioned on the Large Millimeter Telescope in Mexico.</p>
	
	<p>I have previously studied the hot gas X-ray emissions of giant ellipticals using the Chandra X-ray Observatory and XMM-Newton at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. Prior to my pursuit of astrophysics, I had a brief stint at the Solid State Spectroscopy Laboratory at Kyoto University where I conducted the first pilot experiments exploring the properties of atomically-thin transition metal dichalcognides using terahertz microscopy.</p>
