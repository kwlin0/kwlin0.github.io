	<h1>Research</h1>
	<p>I will start work at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory on characterization of detectors in early 2021.</p>
	<p>I was on the TolTEC camera team, working on simulations for planning future surveys when the instrument is commissioned on the <a href="http://lmtgtm.org">Large Millimeter Telescope</a> in Mexico.</p>
	
	<p>I have previously studied the hot gas X-ray emissions of giant ellipticals using the Chandra X-ray Observatory and XMM-Newton at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics as an NSF REU fellow. In collaboration with the <a href="https://cxc.cfa.harvard.edu/GalaxyAtlas/v1/">Chandra Galaxy Atlas</a> team led by <a href="https://cxc.harvard.edu/cdo/cxcstaff/staff_details.php?si=69">Dong-Woo Kim</a>, I worked with Nazma Islam to test the pipeline for an XMM-Newton version of the atlas and analyzed the initial data products from this effort. Prior to my pursuit of astrophysics, I had a brief stint in optical physics at the <a href="http://www.hikari.scphys.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en/index.php">Solid State Spectroscopy Laboratory</a> at Kyoto University where I conducted the first pilot experiments exploring the properties of atomically-thin transition metal dichalcognides using terahertz microscopy.</p>
	<h1>Teaching</h1>
	<p>I am a current graduate student instructor for Astro 160 (Stellar Physics) at Berkeley. Previously, I was an undergraduate teaching assistant and grader for Physics 181, Physics 110, and Astro 105 at UMass.</p>
