<h1>Research</h1>
I currently work on the TolTEC team, completing simulations for the TolTEC camera which will be commissioned on the Large Millimeter Telescope in Mexico.

I have also studied the hot X-ray gas in nearby giant ellipticals at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and conducted the first pilot experiments of terahertz microscopy on transition metal dichalcogenides, an ultrathin nanomaterial with properties analogous to graphene.
