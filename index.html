<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a first year astrophysics graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley. I completed dual degrees in physics and astrophysics with a mathematics minor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, working with <a href="https://www.alexandrapope.com">Alexandra Pope</a> on dusty galaxies for my undergraduate thesis on the <a href="http://toltec.astro.umass.edu">TolTEC camera</a>.</p>
<p>Outside of data wrangling, I play cello and piano. Having been a member in youth symphony orchestras continuously since I was in middle school, I love listening to and watching live classical music performances. I also especially love to travel to national parks and historic sites around the world, of which I keep <a href="https://kwlin0.github.io/travel/">track</a>.</p>
