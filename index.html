<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a first year astrophysics graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley. I completed dual degrees in physics and astrophysics with honors at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, working with Alexandra Pope on dusty galaxies for my undergraduate thesis on the TolTEC camera.</p>
<p>Outside of data wrangling, I play cello, as I have been a member in symphony orchestras continuously since I was in middle school. I love listening to and watching live classical music performances. I also love to travel to national parks and historic sites around the world.</p>
